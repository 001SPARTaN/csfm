# CSFM
Cobalt Strike Field Manual - A quick reference for Windows commands that can be accessed in a beacon console.

# Getting started
CSFM allows users to reference commands from any beacon console. Simply type `search <term>` into a beacon, and you'll see a list of results that match that term.

Once you have identified the command you want to run, you can run the command easily with `runcmd <index>`, where `<index>` is the number next to the search result.

# Usage
CSFM has 4 different options to choose from:

`search <term>`

`tip <term>`

`runcmd <index>(search result)`

`add`

The add command will pop up a dialog window that will have fields to enter the command syntax, the description of the command, and the tags or matching search terms for that specific command you enter. Once that command is added it will populate and get stored into the file 'defs.bin' for later use on future engagements.
