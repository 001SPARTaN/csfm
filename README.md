# CSFM
Cobalt Strike Field Manual - A quick reference for Windows commands that can be accessed in a beacon console.

# Getting started
CSFM allows users to reference commands from any beacon console. Simply type `search <term>` into a beacon, and you'll see a list of results that match that term.

Once you have identified the command you want to run, you can run the command easily with `runcmd <index>`, where `<index>` is the number next to the search result.
